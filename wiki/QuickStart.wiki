#summary Quick Start for new users of SeqPipe.

= Installation =

SeqPipe is written in [http://www.perl.org/ Perl], so please make ensure perl has been installed before you start.

You can download SeqPipe from the [https://code.google.com/p/seqpipe/downloads/list Downloads] page and then extract files from the compressed tarball:
{{{
wget http://seqpipe.googlecode.com/files/seqpipe-v0.4.10-r262.tar.gz
tar xvf seqpipe-v0.4.10-r262.tar.gz
}}}

Or you can directly checkout the source code from subversion (see the [https://code.google.com/p/seqpipe/source/list Source] page).
{{{
svn checkout http://seqpipe.googlecode.com/svn/trunk seqpipe
}}}

Then, add the seqpipe directory to you PATH environment variable, for example:
{{{
export PATH=$(pwd)/seqpipe:$PATH
}}}

Now, you can just type "seqpipe" to run it.

To make it easy next time, you can edit your bash profile (such as ~/.bashrc) to add the PATH exporting line.

For more information, please go to the [Installation] page.

= Write first pipeline =

Create new text file (named as "hello.pipe") as following:
{{{
function hello
{
   echo "Hello SeqPipe!"
}
}}}

Then run the command:
{{{
seqpipe -m hello.pipe hello
}}}

If you see message "Pipeline finished successfully!", Congratulations! You have successfully run your first pipeline.

Now you can find a hidden directory .seqpipe in current working directory, in which log files are stored automatically:

{{{
$ ls .seqpipe
}}}
